              1. What is RGHS (Rajasthan Government Health Scheme)?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Rajasthan Government Health Scheme (RGHS) is formulated to provide
              medical safety for state government employees and pensioners. It
              brings all the healthcare facilities under a single umbrella,
              including hospitalization, treatment, diagnostics, and pharmacy
              coverage.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              The scheme is cashless and paperless, with direct settlement
              between hospitals/pharmacies and the state. This renders RGHS
              medicines cashless and treatment entirely hassle-free for the
              beneficiaries.

              2. How to Apply for an RGHS Card
            </h2>
            <p>
              An RGHS card is necessary to enjoy the benefits under the scheme.
              It&apos;s an ID card and offers access to all the impanelled
              services.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 font-medium">Step-by-Step Process:</p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              If you’re a government employee or pensioner in Rajasthan, getting
              your RGHS (Rajasthan Government Health Scheme) card is the first
              step toward accessing free and cashless medical treatment. To
              begin, head over to the official RGHS portal online. From there,
              you’ll need to log in using your SIPF ID if you’re a current
              employee, or your Pensioner ID if you’ve retired. After you log
              in, you will be required to enter your individual details,
              including those of your family members or dependents who are also
              covered under the scheme. Next, you will need to upload a few
              crucial documents, such as your proof of identity and either an
              employment certificate or pension document, based on your
              category. Once all of this is submitted, the application is
              processed by the relevant government department. If all is well,
              your RGHS card will be sanctioned—you can then download and print
              the card from the portal itself. It should be noted that this card
              is not merely a gesture. It&apos;s also compulsory for accessing
              cashless medical care, whether you&apos;re collecting free
              medicines from an RGHS-listed shop or availing treatment from an
              impanelled hospital. Without it, you won&apos;t be able to take
              advantage of the entire gamut of services the scheme provides, so
              ensure you keep it handy and safe.

              3. RGHS for Pensioners
            </h2>
            <p>
              The scheme is particularly useful for pensioners, who tend to have
              greater medical requirements after retirement.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              One of the biggest advantages of the Rajasthan Government Health
              Scheme (RGHS) is its focus on cashless and stress-free healthcare,
              especially for government employees and pensioners. With the RGHS
              card, beneficiaries can access medicines free of cost from any
              empanelled RGHS pharmacy across the state. In addition to
              medicines, the scheme also covers free or heavily subsidised
              diagnostic tests, helping reduce out-of-pocket expenses for
              routine and emergency health checkups. Another important feature
              of RGHS is that it doesn’t just benefit the cardholder—it also
              covers spouses, dependent children, and even parents, ensuring the
              whole family is protected. For senior citizens and pensioners,
              this means peace of mind during retirement, with fewer worries
              about rising medical costs. To make healthcare even more
              convenient, HealthSquare Pharmacy—a trusted name in RGHS
              services—offers home delivery of medicines, transparent digital
              billing, and easy access to RGHS-approved drugs. This makes it
              easier for pensioners and others to receive their prescribed
              medicines without visiting the pharmacy in person, saving time and
              effort while ensuring continued treatment.

            </h2>

              The RGHS scheme&apos;s advantages are extensive and encompass
              overall healthcare coverage.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              The Rajasthan Government Health Scheme (RGHS) offers a wide range
              of health benefits that make medical care more accessible and
              stress-free for government employees, pensioners, and their
              families. One of the key features is cashless hospitalization at
              any RGHS-empanelled hospital, allowing patients to receive
              treatment without the burden of upfront payments. In addition, the
              scheme ensures cashless access to prescribed medicines from
              authorized pharmacies, including HealthSquare Pharmacy—a trusted
              name in RGHS services. HealthSquare Pharmacy not only provides a
              wide range of RGHS-covered medicines but also offers home delivery
              and clear digital billing, making it incredibly convenient,
              especially for elderly patients and pensioners. The RGHS card
              covers both OPD (Outpatient Department) and IPD (Inpatient
              Department) services, so beneficiaries are covered for everything
              from regular doctor visits to hospital admissions. It also
              includes essential diagnostic services, such as lab tests and
              scans, further reducing out-of-pocket expenses. Another major
              advantage is the inclusion of dependents, with spouse, children,
              and parents all eligible for coverage under a single card. For any
              questions or support, RGHS provides a dedicated toll-free
              helpline, ensuring help is always just a phone call away. With
              service providers like HealthSquare Pharmacy working alongside the
              RGHS scheme, accessing quality healthcare has never been easier or
              more efficient.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              These RGHS scheme benefits ensure that both employees and
              pensioners receive the best medical care without financial burden.
